        <p> This is a Consul Connect Layer 4 Demo.</p>
        <p> Welcome to the Petshop.   Each window below loads data from an instance of a picture service related
        to a specific animal.   This web application binds to a localhost port and then sends requests for each pet
        to a locally bound upstream that's unique for each endpoint.   
        <p> Consul Connect automatically creates certificates for the proxy endpoints to both identify and secure traffic
        between endpoints.   It also allows for setting Intentions which either allows or disallows connections
        to occur.
